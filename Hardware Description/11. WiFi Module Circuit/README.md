# WiFi Module Circuit Descreption

1. SN74LVC245 is a 8 channel transiever IC which is used to convert the voltage from 5v to 3.3v as WiFi module works on 3.3v.
2. ATWINC1510 wifi module is used for industrial IOT related applications, like to upload the datalogger parameters to web based data visualization website.
3. Led 1 shows the status whether WiFi is connected to the WiFi network or not.
4. Led 2 blinks when WiFi module recieves the data or transmits the data.
5. Led 3 light up when their is some hardware related fault.
6. BSS138 MOSFET is used to convert the voltage on MISO pin.

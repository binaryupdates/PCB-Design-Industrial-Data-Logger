# DC Motor Speed Controller Descreption

1.	This circuit is used to control the speed of DC motor.
2.	The rating of DC Motor speed controller is 12/24 V, 3Amps.
3.	This circuit uses EL357 optocoupler IC which is used to isolate the microcontroller pin from the output circuitry.
4.	TIP120 is the Darlington pair transistor which is used to control the speed of DC motor.
5.	M7 which is a SS34 schottky diode it is used to provide the protection form back EMF.
6.	R63 is used to limit the current flowing from the base of T1P120 transistor.
7.	MTR_CTRL pin is connected to the PWM pin of the Atmega256 microcontroller.

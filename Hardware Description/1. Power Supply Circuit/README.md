# Power Supply Circuit Descreption

* Power supply circuit contains two different circuit to generate two diffrent voltage levels
  1. First circuit is a SMPS circuit which generates 5v output.
  2. Second one is a linear regulator circuit which generates 3.3v Output.
* SMPS Circuit generates 5V using LM2596-5.0 IC which is from Texas Instruments.
* Linear regulator circuit generates 3.3v using AMS1117-3.3 IC which is from Monolithic semiconductors.
* The power supply circuit contains following features.
  1. Reverse polarity protection.
  2. Overvoltage protection.
  3. Surge protection (Protection from Lightning).
  4. Overcurrent protection.
  5. Under voltage Lockout arrangement.
* The power supply circuit also have a LED to notify whether system is powered or not.
